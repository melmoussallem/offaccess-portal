# 🚂 Railway Backend Deployment Guide

## ✅ **Fixed Configuration**

The deployment should now work correctly. The issue was that Railway was trying to build the entire project (including frontend) instead of just the backend.

### **What I Fixed:**
- ✅ Added `.railwayignore` to exclude frontend files
- ✅ Updated `railway.json` configuration
- ✅ Added `railway.toml` for better configuration
- ✅ Ensured `package.json` start script only runs backend

## 🚀 **Deploy to Railway**

### **Step 1: Go to Railway**
1. Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up/login with your GitHub account

### **Step 2: Create New Project**
1. Click **"New Project"**
2. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. Choose your repository: `melmoussallem/offaccess-portal`
4. Click **"Deploy"**

### **Step 3: Configure Environment Variables**
Once deployed, go to your project and:

1. Click on your project
2. Go to **"Variables"** tab
3. Add these environment variables:

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://melmoussallem:aQI5qbL23FKti3cV@cluster0.gjbkrwp.mongodb.net/digital-wholesale-catalogue?retryWrites=true&w=majority
JWT_SECRET=c4e636a44a346e72420e576d21bcd4ff6690e2d131d1e0b998fcb71a7e46ff8c
EMAIL_USER=info@offaccess.com
EMAIL_PASS=wmyj okmb jeon vvbw
ADMIN_EMAIL=info@offaccess.com
NODE_ENV=production
FRONTEND_URL=https://portal.offaccess.com
```

### **Step 4: Get Your Railway URL**
After successful deployment, Railway will give you a URL like:
`https://your-app-name.railway.app`

**Please share your Railway URL** so I can help you configure the frontend deployment to Vercel.

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

If deployment still fails:
1. Check the **"Deployments"** tab for error logs
2. Make sure all environment variables are set
3. The backend should start on port 5000 automatically

## 📋 **Next Steps**
Once Railway deployment is successful:
1. ✅ Get your Railway backend URL
2. 🚀 Deploy frontend to Vercel
3. 🌐 Configure custom domain: `portal.offaccess.com`

**Let me know your Railway URL when it's deployed!** 🚀
