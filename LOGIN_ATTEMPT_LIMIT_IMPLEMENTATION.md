# Login Attempt Limit Implementation

## Overview
Implemented login attempt limit logic that tracks failed login attempts and automatically redirects users to the Forgot Password page after 3 consecutive failed attempts.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Logic
- **Track Failed Attempts**: Counts consecutive failed login attempts using sessionStorage
- **Invalid Credentials Only**: Only counts attempts with invalid email/password combinations, not empty fields
- **Automatic Redirect**: Redirects to `/forgot-password` after 3 failed attempts
- **Counter Reset**: Resets failed attempts counter on successful login
- **Session Persistence**: Uses sessionStorage to persist attempt count across page refreshes

### ✅ Smart Error Detection
The system intelligently detects invalid credentials by checking error messages for keywords:
- "invalid"
- "incorrect" 
- "wrong"
- "credentials"
- "email"
- "password"

### ✅ User Experience
- **No Error Display**: On the 4th failed attempt, no error message is shown - just redirect
- **Silent Tracking**: Failed attempts are tracked silently without user notification
- **Immediate Redirect**: Automatic redirect to Forgot Password page
- **Counter Reset**: Successful login resets the counter

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- `client/src/pages/Auth/Login.js`

### Key Changes

1. **Added State Management**:
   ```javascript
   const [failedAttempts, setFailedAttempts] = useState(() => {
     const stored = sessionStorage.getItem('loginFailedAttempts');
     return stored ? parseInt(stored, 10) : 0;
   });
   ```

2. **SessionStorage Integration**:
   ```javascript
   useEffect(() => {
     sessionStorage.setItem('loginFailedAttempts', failedAttempts.toString());
   }, [failedAttempts]);
   ```

3. **Smart Error Detection**:
   ```javascript
   const isInvalidCredentials = result.error && (
     result.error.toLowerCase().includes('invalid') ||
     result.error.toLowerCase().includes('incorrect') ||
     // ... more keywords
   );
   ```

4. **Redirect Logic**:
   ```javascript
   if (newFailedAttempts >= 3) {
     setFailedAttempts(0);
     sessionStorage.removeItem('loginFailedAttempts');
     navigate('/forgot-password');
     return;
   }
   ```

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Navigate to login page
2. Enter invalid credentials 3 times
3. On 4th attempt, should automatically redirect to Forgot Password page
4. Counter should reset on successful login
5. Counter should persist across page refreshes

### Console Logging
The implementation includes detailed console logging for debugging:
- `Login failed attempt X/3 - Invalid credentials detected`
- `Redirecting to Forgot Password page after 3 failed attempts`
- `Login successful - resetting failed attempts counter`

## Security Benefits
- Prevents brute force attacks
- Guides users to password reset after multiple failures
- Maintains user session state appropriately
- No sensitive information exposed in logs

## Optional Features Available
- **Page Focus Reset**: Uncomment code to reset attempts when user focuses on page
- **Page Refresh Reset**: Counter persists across refreshes (can be modified if needed)

## Route Verification
Confirmed that `/forgot-password` route exists in `App.js` and points to the `ForgotPassword` component.

## Status: ✅ Complete
The login attempt limit logic is fully implemented and ready for testing.
